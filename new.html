    <h4> The Beginning of Knowledge</h4>

    <p ><a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/1-1.htm">1</a>The proverbs of Solomon the son of David, king of Israel:</p>
    
    <p><a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/1-2.htm">2</a>To know wisdom and instruction,
    To perceive the words of understanding,</p>
    
    <p><a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/1-3.htm">3</a>To receive the instruction of wisdom,
    Justice, judgment, and equity;</p>
    
    <p><a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/1-4.htm">4</a>To give prudence to the simple,
    To the young man knowledge and discretion—</p>
    
    <p><a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/1-5.htm">5</a>A wise man will hear and increase learning,
    And a man of understanding will attain wise counsel,</p>
    
    <p><a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/1-6.htm">6</a>To understand a proverb and an enigma,
    The words of the wise and their riddles.</p>
    
    <p><a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/1-7.htm">7</a>The fear of the Lord is the beginning of knowledge,
    But fools despise wisdom and instruction.</p>
    
    <h4>Shun Evil Counsel</h4>
    <p><a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/1-8.htm">8</a>My son, hear the instruction of your father,
    And do not forsake the law of your mother;</p>
    
    <p><a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/1-9.htm">9</a>For they will be a graceful ornament on your head,
    And chains about your neck.</p>
    
    <p><a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/1-10.htm">10</a>My son, if sinners entice you,
    Do not consent.</p>
    <p><a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/1-11.htm">11</a>If they say, “Come with us,
    Let us lie in wait to shed blood;
    Let us lurk secretly for the innocent without cause;</p>
    <p><a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/1-12.htm">12</a>Let us swallow them alive like Sheol,
    And whole, like those who go down to the Pit;</p>
    <p><a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/1-13.htm">13</a>We shall find all kinds of precious possessions,
    We shall fill our houses with spoil;</p>
    <p><a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/1-14.htm">14</a>Cast in your lot among us,
    Let us all have one purse”—</p>
    <p><a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/1-15.htm">15</a>My son, do not walk in the way with them,
    Keep your foot from their path;</p>
    <p><a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/1-16.htm">16</a>For their feet run to evil,
    And they make haste to shed blood.</p>
    <p><a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/1-17.htm">17</a>Surely, in vain the net is spread
    In the sight of any bird;</p>
    <p><a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/1-18.htm">18</a>But they lie in wait for their own blood,
    They lurk secretly for their own lives.</p>
    <p><a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/1-19.htm">19</a>So are the ways of everyone who is greedy for gain;
    It takes away the life of its owners.</p>
    
    <h4>The Call of Wisdom</h4>
    <p><a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/1-20.htm">20</a>Wisdom calls aloud outside;
    She raises her voice in the open squares.</p>
    <p><a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/1-21.htm">21</a>She cries out in the chief concourses,
    At the openings of the gates in the city
    She speaks her words:</p>
    <p><a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/1-22.htm">22</a>“How long, you simple ones, will you love simplicity?
    For scorners delight in their scorning,
    And fools hate knowledge.</p>
    <p><a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/1-23.htm">23</a>Turn at my rebuke;
    Surely I will pour out my spirit on you;
    I will make my words known to you.</p>
    <p><a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/1-24.htm">24</a>Because I have called and you refused,
    I have stretched out my hand and no one regarded,</p>
    <p><a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/1-25.htm">25</a>Because you disdained all my counsel,
    And would have none of my rebuke,</p>
    <p><a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/1-26.htm">26</a>I also will laugh at your calamity;
    I will mock when your terror comes,</p>
    <p><a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/1-27.htm">27</a>When your terror comes like a storm,
    And your destruction comes like a whirlwind,
    When distress and anguish come upon you.</p>
    
    <p><a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/1-28.htm">28</a>“Then they will call on me, but I will not answer;
    They will seek me diligently, but they will not find me.</p>
    <p><a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/1-29.htm">29</a>Because they hated knowledge
    And did not choose the fear of the Lord,</p>
    <p><a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/1-30.htm">31</a>They would have none of my counsel
    And despised my every rebuke.</p>
    <p><a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/1-31.htm">31</a>Therefore they shall eat the fruit of their own way,
    And be filled to the full with their own fancies.</p>
    <p><a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/1-32.htm">32</a>For the turning away of the simple will slay them,
    And the complacency of fools will destroy them;</p>
    <p><a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/1-33.htm">33</a>But whoever listens to me will dwell safely,
    And will be secure, without fear of evil.”</p>
