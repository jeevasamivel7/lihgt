<h2>Exodus 31</h2>


<h4>Artisans for Building the Tabernacle</h4>


<p><a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/31-1.htm" target="_blank">1</a>Then the Lord spoke to Moses, saying: </p>
<p><a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/31-2.htm" target="_blank">2</a>“See, I have called by name Bezalel the son of Uri, the son of Hur, of the tribe of Judah. 
<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/31-3.htm" target="_blank">3</a>And I have filled him with the Spirit of God, in wisdom, in understanding, in knowledge, and in all manner of workmanship,
<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/31-4.htm" target="_blank">4</a>to design artistic works, to work in gold, in silver, in bronze, 
<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/31-5.htm" target="_blank">5</a>in cutting jewels for setting, in carving wood, and to work in all manner of workmanship. </p>


<p><a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/31-6.htm" target="_blank">6</a>“And I, indeed I, have appointed with him Aholiab the son of Ahisamach, of the tribe of Dan; and I have put wisdom in the hearts of all the gifted artisans, that they may make all that I have commanded you:
<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/31-7.htm" target="_blank">7</a>the tabernacle of meeting, the ark of the Testimony and the mercy seat that is on it, and all the furniture of the tabernacle—</p>


<p><a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/31-8.htm" target="_blank">8</a>the table and its utensils, the pure gold lampstand with all its utensils, the altar of incense,
<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/31-9.htm" target="_blank">9</a>the altar of burnt offering with all its utensils, and the laver and its base— </p>


<p><a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/31-10.htm" target="_blank">10</a>the garments of ministry, the holy garments for Aaron the priest and the garments of his sons, to minister as priests, </p>


<p><a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/31-11.htm" target="_blank">11</a>and the anointing oil and sweet incense for the holy place. According to all that I have commanded you they shall do.”</p>


<h4>The Sabbath Law</h4>




<p><a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/31-12.htm" target="_blank">12</a>And the Lord spoke to Moses, saying, </p>


<p><a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/31-13.htm" target="_blank">13</a>“Speak also to the children of Israel, saying: ‘Surely My Sabbaths you shall keep, for it is a sign between Me and you throughout your generations, that you may know that I am the Lord who sanctifies you.
<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/31-14.htm" target="_blank">14</a>You shall keep the Sabbath, therefore, for it is holy to you. Everyone who profanes it shall surely be put to death; for whoever does any work on it, that person shall be cut off from among his people.
<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/31-15.htm" target="_blank">15</a>Work shall be done for six days, but the seventh is the Sabbath of rest, holy to the Lord. Whoever does any work on the Sabbath day, he shall surely be put to death. 
<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/31-16.htm" target="_blank">16</a>Therefore the children of Israel shall keep the Sabbath, to observe the Sabbath throughout their generations as a perpetual covenant.
<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/31-17.htm" target="_blank">17</a>It is a sign between Me and the children of Israel forever; for in six days the Lord made the heavens and the earth, and on the seventh day He rested and was refreshed.’ ”</p>


<p><a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/31-18.htm" target="_blank">18</a>And when He had made an end of speaking with him on Mount Sinai, He gave Moses two tablets of the Testimony, tablets of stone, written with the finger of God.</p>
