<h2>Exodus 6</h2>


<h4>God Renews His Promise to Israel</h4>


<p><a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/6-1.htm" target="_blank">1</a>Then the Lord said to Moses, “Now you shall see what I will do to Pharaoh. For with a strong hand he will let them go, and with a strong hand he will drive them out of his land.” </p>
<p><a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/6-2.htm" target="_blank">2</a>And God spoke to Moses and said to him: “I am the Lord. </p>

<p><a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/6-3.htm" target="_blank">3</a>I appeared to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob, as God Almighty, but by My name Lord I was not known to them.
<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/6-4.htm" target="_blank">4</a>I have also established My covenant with them, to give them the land of Canaan, the land of their pilgrimage, in which they were strangers.

<p><a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/6-5.htm" target="_blank">5</a>And I have also heard the groaning of the children of Israel whom the Egyptians keep in bondage, and I have remembered My covenant.</p>


<p><a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/6-6.htm" target="_blank">6</a>Therefore say to the children of Israel: ‘I am the Lord; I will bring you out from under the burdens of the Egyptians, I will rescue you from their bondage, and I will redeem you with an outstretched arm and with great judgments.

<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/6-7.htm" target="_blank">7</a>I will take you as My people, and I will be your God. Then you shall know that I am the Lord your God who brings you out from under the burdens of the Egyptians.

<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/6-8.htm" target="_blank">8</a>And I will bring you into the land which I swore to give to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob; and I will give it to you as a heritage: I am the Lord.’ ”

<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/6-9.htm" target="_blank">9</a>So Moses spoke thus to the children of Israel; but they did not heed Moses, because of anguish of spirit and cruel bondage.</p>



<p><a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/6-10.htm" target="_blank">10</a>And the Lord spoke to Moses, saying, </p>

<p><a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/6-11.htm" target="_blank">11</a>“Go in, tell Pharaoh king of Egypt to let the children of Israel go out of his land.”</p>


<p><a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/6-12.htm" target="_blank">12</a>And Moses spoke before the Lord, saying, “The children of Israel have not heeded me. How then shall Pharaoh heed me, for I am of uncircumcised lips?” </p>

<p><a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/6-13.htm" target="_blank">13</a>Then the Lord spoke to Moses and Aaron, and gave them a command for the children of Israel and for Pharaoh king of Egypt, to bring the children of Israel out of the land of Egypt.</p>



<h4>The Family of Moses and Aaron</h4>


<p><a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/6-14.htm" target="_blank">14</a>These are the heads of their fathers’ houses: The sons of Reuben, the firstborn of Israel, were Hanoch, Pallu, Hezron, and Carmi. These are the families of Reuben. 

<p><a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/6-15.htm" target="_blank">15</a>And the sons of Simeon were Jemuel, Jamin, Ohad, Jachin, Zohar, and Shaul the son of a Canaanite woman. These are the families of Simeon. 

<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/6-16.htm" target="_blank">16</a>These are the names of the sons of Levi according to their generations: Gershon, Kohath, and Merari. And the years of the life of Levi were one hundred and thirty-seven. 

<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/6-17.htm" target="_blank">17</a>The sons of Gershon were Libni and Shimi according to their families.

<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/6-18.htm" target="_blank">18</a>And the sons of Kohath were Amram, Izhar, Hebron, and Uzziel. And the years of the life of Kohath were one hundred and thirty-three. 

<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/6-19.htm" target="_blank">19</a>The sons of Merari were Mahli and Mushi. These are the families of Levi according to their generations.</p>


<p><a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/6-20.htm" target="_blank">20</a>Now Amram took for himself Jochebed, his father’s sister, as wife; and she bore him Aaron and Moses. And the years of the life of Amram were one hundred and thirty-seven.

<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/6-21.htm" target="_blank">21</a>The sons of Izhar were Korah, Nepheg, and Zichri.

<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/6-22.htm" target="_blank">22</a>And the sons of Uzziel were Mishael, Elzaphan, and Zithri.

<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/6-23.htm" target="_blank">23</a>Aaron took to himself Elisheba, daughter of Amminadab, sister of Nahshon, as wife; and she bore him Nadab, Abihu, Eleazar, and Ithamar. </p>

<p><a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/6-24.htm" target="_blank">24</a>And the sons of Korah were Assir, Elkanah, and Abiasaph. These are the families of the Korahites.

<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/6-25.htm" target="_blank">25</a>Eleazar, Aaron’s son, took for himself one of the daughters of Putiel as wife; and she bore him Phinehas. These are the heads of the fathers’ houses of the Levites according to their families.</p>


<p><a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/6-26.htm" target="_blank">26</a>These are the same Aaron and Moses to whom the Lord said, “Bring out the children of Israel from the land of Egypt according to their armies.”

<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/6-27.htm" target="_blank">27</a>These are the ones who spoke to Pharaoh king of Egypt, to bring out the children of Israel from Egypt. These are the same Moses and Aaron.</p>



<h4>Aaron Is Moses’ Spokesman</h4>



<p><a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/6-28.htm" target="_blank">28</a>And it came to pass, on the day the Lord spoke to Moses in the land of Egypt,

<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/6-29.htm" target="_blank">29</a></p>that the Lord spoke to Moses, saying, “I am the Lord. Speak to Pharaoh king of Egypt all that I say to you.”</p>


<p><a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/6-30.htm" target="_blank">30</a>But Moses said before the Lord, “Behold, I am of uncircumcised lips, and how shall Pharaoh heed me?” </p>
