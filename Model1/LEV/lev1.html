<h2>Lev 1</h2>


<h4>The Burnt Offering</h4>


<p><a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/1-1.htm" target="_blank">1</a>Now the Lord called to Moses, and spoke to him from the tabernacle of meeting, saying, 
<a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/1-2.htm" target="_blank">2</a>“Speak to the children of Israel, and say to them: ‘When any one of you brings an offering to the Lord, you shall bring your offering of the livestock—of the herd and of the flock.</P>

<p><a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/1-3.htm" target="_blank">3</a>‘If his offering is a burnt sacrifice of the herd, let him offer a male without blemish; he shall offer it of his own free will at the door of the tabernacle of meeting before the Lord. 
<a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/1-4.htm" target="_blank">4</a>Then he shall put his hand on the head of the burnt offering, and it will be accepted on his behalf to make atonement for him. 
<a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/1-5.htm" target="_blank">5</a>He shall kill the bull before the Lord; and the priests, Aaron’s sons, shall bring the blood and sprinkle the blood all around on the altar that is by the door of the tabernacle of meeting.
<a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/1-6.htm" target="_blank">6</a>And he shall skin the burnt offering and cut it into its pieces. 
<a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/1-7.htm" target="_blank">7</a>The sons of Aaron the priest shall put fire on the altar, and lay the wood in order on the fire. 
<a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/1-8.htm" target="_blank">8</a>Then the priests, Aaron’s sons, shall lay the parts, the head, and the fat in order on the wood that is on the fire upon the altar; 
<a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/1-9.htm" target="_blank">9</a>but he shall wash its entrails and its legs with water. And the priest shall burn all on the altar as a burnt sacrifice, an offering made by fire, a sweet aroma to the Lord.</P>

<p><a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/1-10.htm" target="_blank">10</a>‘If his offering is of the flocks—of the sheep or of the goats—as a burnt sacrifice, he shall bring a male without blemish. 
<p><a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/1-11.htm" target="_blank">11</a>He shall kill it on the north side of the altar before the Lord; and the priests, Aaron’s sons, shall sprinkle its blood all around on the altar.
<a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/1-12.htm" target="_blank">12</a>And he shall cut it into its pieces, with its head and its fat; and the priest shall lay them in order on the wood that is on the fire upon the altar; </P>

<p><a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/1-13.htm" target="_blank">13</a>but he shall wash the entrails and the legs with water. Then the priest shall bring it all and burn it on the altar; it is a burnt sacrifice, an offering made by fire, a sweet aroma to the Lord. </P>

<p><a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/1-14.htm" target="_blank">14</a>‘And if the burnt sacrifice of his offering to the Lord is of birds, then he shall bring his offering of turtledoves or young pigeons.
<a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/1-15.htm" target="_blank">15</a>The priest shall bring it to the altar, wring off its head, and burn it on the altar; its blood shall be drained out at the side of the altar.
<a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/1-16.htm" target="_blank">16</a>And he shall remove its crop with its feathers and cast it beside the altar on the east side, into the place for ashes.
<a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/1-17.htm" target="_blank">17</a>Then he shall split it at its wings, but shall not divide it completely; and the priest shall burn it on the altar, on the wood that is on the fire. It is a burnt sacrifice, an offering made by fire, a sweet aroma to the Lord.</P>
