<h2> Job 29 </h2>


<h4>Job's Summary Defense</h4>

<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/29-1.htm" target="_blank">1</a>Job further continued his discourse, and said:</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/29-2.htm" target="_blank">2</a>"Oh, that I were as in months past,As in the days when God watched over me;</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/29-3.htm" target="_blank">3</a>When His lamp shone upon my head,And when by His light I walked through darkness;</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/29-4.htm" target="_blank">4</a>Just as I was in the days of my prime,When the friendly counsel of God was over my tent;</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/29-5.htm" target="_blank">5</a>When the Almighty was yet with me,When my children were around me;</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/29-6.htm" target="_blank">6</a>When my steps were bathed with cream,And the rock poured out rivers of oil for me!</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/29-7.htm" target="_blank">7</a>"When I went out to the gate by the city,When I took my seat in the open square,</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/29-8.htm" target="_blank">8</a>The young men saw me and hid,And the aged arose and stood;</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/29-9.htm" target="_blank">9</a>The princes refrained from talking,And put their hand on their mouth;</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/29-10.htm" target="_blank">10</a>The voice of nobles was hushed,And their tongue stuck to the roof of their mouth.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/29-11.htm" target="_blank">11</a>When the ear heard, then it blessed me,And when the eye saw, then it approved me;</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/29-12.htm" target="_blank">12</a>Because I delivered the poor who cried out,The fatherless and the one who had no helper.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/29-13.htm" target="_blank">13</a>The blessing of a perishing man came upon me,And I caused the widow's heart to sing for joy.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/29-14.htm" target="_blank">14</a>I put on righteousness, and it clothed me;My justice was like a robe and a turban.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/29-15.htm" target="_blank">15</a>I was eyes to the blind,And I was feet to the lame.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/29-16.htm" target="_blank">16</a>I was a father to the poor,And I searched out the case that I did not know.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/29-17.htm" target="_blank">17</a>I broke the fangs of the wicked,And plucked the victim from his teeth.</p>

<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/29-18.htm" target="_blank">18</a>"Then I said, 'I shall die in my nest,And multiply my days as the sand.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/29-19.htm" target="_blank">19</a>My root is spread out to the waters,And the dew lies all night on my branch.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/29-20.htm" target="_blank">20</a>My glory is fresh within me,And my bow is renewed in my hand.'</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/29-21.htm" target="_blank">21</a>"Men listened to me and waited,And kept silence for my counsel.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/29-22.htm" target="_blank">22</a>After my words they did not speak again,And my speech settled on them as dew.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/29-23.htm" target="_blank">23</a>They waited for me as for the rain,And they opened their mouth wide as for the spring rain.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/29-24.htm" target="_blank">24</a>If I mocked at them, they did not believe it,And the light of my countenance they did not cast down.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/29-25.htm" target="_blank">25</a>I chose the way for them, and sat as chief;So I dwelt as a king in the army,As one who comforts mourners.</p>
