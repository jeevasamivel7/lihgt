<h2> Job 34 </h2>


<h4>Elihu Proclaims God's Justice</h4>

<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/34-1.htm" target="_blank">1</a>Elihu further answered and said:</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/34-2.htm" target="_blank">2</a>"Hear my words, you wise men;Give ear to me, you who have knowledge.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/34-3.htm" target="_blank">3</a>For the ear tests wordsAs the palate tastes food.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/34-4.htm" target="_blank">4</a>Let us choose justice for ourselves;Let us know among ourselves what is good.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/34-5.htm" target="_blank">5</a>"For Job has said, 'I am righteous,But God has taken away my justice;</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/34-6.htm" target="_blank">6</a>Should I lie concerning my right?My wound is incurable, though I am without transgression.'</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/34-7.htm" target="_blank">7</a>What man is like Job,Who drinks scorn like water,</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/34-8.htm" target="_blank">8</a>Who goes in company with the workers of iniquity,And walks with wicked men?</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/34-9.htm" target="_blank">9</a>For he has said,"It profits a man nothingThat he should delight in God.'</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/34-10.htm" target="_blank">10</a>"Therefore listen to me, you men of understanding:Far be it from God to do wickedness,And from the Almighty to commit iniquity.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/34-11.htm" target="_blank">11</a>For He repays man according to his work,And makes man to find a reward according to his way.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/34-12.htm" target="_blank">12</a>Surely God will never do wickedly,Nor will the Almighty pervert justice.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/34-13.htm" target="_blank">13</a>Who gave Him charge over the earth?Or who appointed Him over the whole world?</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/34-14.htm" target="_blank">14</a>If He should set His heart on it,If He should gather to Himself His Spirit and His breath,</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/34-15.htm" target="_blank">15</a>All flesh would perish together,And man would return to dust.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/34-16.htm" target="_blank">16</a>"If you have understanding, hear this;Listen to the sound of my words:</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/34-17.htm" target="_blank">17</a>Should one who hates justice govern?Will you condemn Him who is most just?</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/34-18.htm" target="_blank">18</a>Is it fitting to say to a king, 'You are worthless,'And to nobles, 'You are wicked'?</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/34-19.htm" target="_blank">19</a>Yet He is not partial to princes,Nor does He regard the rich more than the poor;For they are all the work of His hands.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/34-20.htm" target="_blank">20</a>In a moment they die, in the middle of the night;The people are shaken and pass away;The mighty are taken away without a hand.</p>

<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/34-21.htm" target="_blank">21</a>"For His eyes are on the ways of man,And He sees all his steps.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/34-22.htm" target="_blank">22</a>There is no darkness nor shadow of deathWhere the workers of iniquity may hide themselves.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/34-23.htm" target="_blank">23</a>For He need not further consider a man,That he should go before God in judgment.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/34-24.htm" target="_blank">24</a>He breaks in pieces mighty men without inquiry,And sets others in their place.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/34-25.htm" target="_blank">25</a>Therefore He knows their works;He overthrows them in the night,And they are crushed.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/34-26.htm" target="_blank">26</a>He strikes them as wicked menIn the open sight of others,</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/34-27.htm" target="_blank">27</a>Because they turned back from Him,And would not consider any of His ways,</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/34-28.htm" target="_blank">28</a>So that they caused the cry of the poor to come to Him;For He hears the cry of the afflicted.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/34-29.htm" target="_blank">29</a>When He gives quietness, who then can make trouble?And when He hides His face, who then can see Him,Whether it is against a nation or a man alone?"</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/34-30.htm" target="_blank">30</a>That the hypocrite should not reign,Lest the people be ensnared.</p>

<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/34-31.htm" target="_blank">31</a>"For has anyone said to God,'I have borne chastening;I will offend no more;</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/34-32.htm" target="_blank">32</a>Teach me what I do not see;If I have done iniquity, I will do no more'?</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/34-33.htm" target="_blank">33</a>Should He repay it according to your terms,Just because you disavow it?You must choose, and not I;Therefore speak what you know.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/34-34.htm" target="_blank">34</a>"Men of understanding say to me,Wise men who listen to me:</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/34-35.htm" target="_blank">35</a>"Job speaks without knowledge,His words are without wisdom.'</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/34-36.htm" target="_blank">36</a>Oh, that Job were tried to the utmost,Because his answers are like those of wicked men!</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/34-37.htm" target="_blank">37</a>For he adds rebellion to his sin;He claps his hands among us,And multiplies his words against God."</p>
