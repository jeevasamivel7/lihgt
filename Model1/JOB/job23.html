<h2> Job 23 </h2>


<h4>Job Proclaims God's Righteous Judgments</h4>

<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/23-1.htm" target="_blank">1</a>Then Job answered and said:</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/23-2.htm" target="_blank">2</a>"Even today my complaint is bitter;My hand is listless because of my groaning.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/23-3.htm" target="_blank">3</a>Oh, that I knew where I might find Him,That I might come to His seat!</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/23-4.htm" target="_blank">4</a>I would present my case before Him,And fill my mouth with arguments.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/23-5.htm" target="_blank">5</a>I would know the words which He would answer me,And understand what He would say to me.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/23-6.htm" target="_blank">6</a>Would He contend with me in His great power?No! But He would take note of me.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/23-7.htm" target="_blank">7</a>There the upright could reason with Him,And I would be delivered forever from my Judge.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/23-8.htm" target="_blank">8</a>"Look, I go forward, but He is not there,And backward, but I cannot perceive Him;</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/23-9.htm" target="_blank">9</a>When He works on the left hand, I cannot behold Him;When He turns to the right hand, I cannot see Him.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/23-10.htm" target="_blank">10</a>But He knows the way that I take;When He has tested me, I shall come forth as gold.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/23-11.htm" target="_blank">11</a>My foot has held fast to His steps;I have kept His way and not turned aside.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/23-12.htm" target="_blank">12</a> have not departed from the commandment of His lips;I have treasured the words of His mouthMore than my necessary food.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/12-13.htm" target="_blank">13</a>"But He is unique, and who can make Him change?And whatever His soul desires, that He does.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/23-14.htm" target="_blank">14</a>For He performs what is appointed for me,And many such things are with Him.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/23-15.htm" target="_blank">15</a>Therefore I am terrified at His presence;When I consider this, I am afraid of Him.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/23-16.htm" target="_blank">16</a>For God made my heart weak,And the Almighty terrifies me;</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/23-17.htm" target="_blank">17</a>Because I was not cut off from the presence of darkness,And He did not hide deep darkness from my face.</p>
