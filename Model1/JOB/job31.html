<h2> Job 31 </h2>


<h4>Job Defends His Righteousness</h4>

<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/31-1.htm" target="_blank">1</a>"I have made a covenant with my eyes;Why then should I look upon a young woman?</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/31-2.htm" target="_blank">2</a>For what is the allotment of God from above,And the inheritance of the Almighty from on high?</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/31-3.htm" target="_blank">3</a>Is it not destruction for the wicked,And disaster for the workers of iniquity?</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/31-4.htm" target="_blank">4</a>Does He not see my ways,And count all my steps?</p>

<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/31-5.htm" target="_blank">5</a>"If I have walked with falsehood,Or if my foot has hastened to deceit,</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/31-6.htm" target="_blank">6</a>Let me be weighed on honest scales,That God may know my integrity.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/31-7.htm" target="_blank">7</a>If my step has turned from the way,Or my heart walked after my eyes,Or if any spot adheres to my hands,</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/31-8.htm" target="_blank">8</a>Then let me sow, and another eat;Yes, let my harvest be rooted out.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/31-9.htm" target="_blank">9</a>"If my heart has been enticed by a woman,Or if I have lurked at my neighbor's door,</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/31-10.htm" target="_blank">10</a>Then let my wife grind for another,And let others bow down over her.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/31-11.htm" target="_blank">11</a>For that would be wickedness;Yes, it would be iniquity deserving of judgment.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/31-12.htm" target="_blank">12</a>For that would be a fire that consumes to destruction,And would root out all my increase.</p>

<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/31-13.htm" target="_blank">13</a>"If I have despised the cause of my male or female servantWhen they complained against me,</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/31-14.htm" target="_blank">14</a>What then shall I do when God rises up?When He punishes, how shall I answer Him?</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/31-15.htm" target="_blank">15</a>Did not He who made me in the womb make them?Did not the same One fashion us in the womb?</p>

<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/31-16.htm" target="_blank">16</a>"If I have kept the poor from their desire,Or caused the eyes of the widow to fail,</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/31-17.htm" target="_blank">17</a>Or eaten my morsel by myself,So that the fatherless could not eat of it</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/31-18.htm" target="_blank">18</a>But from my youth I reared him as a father,And from my mother's womb I guided the widow);</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/31-19.htm" target="_blank">19</a>If I have seen anyone perish for lack of clothing,Or any poor man without covering;</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/31-20.htm" target="_blank">20</a>If his heart has not blessed me,And if he was not warmed with the fleece of my sheep;</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/31-21.htm" target="_blank">21</a>If I have raised my hand against the fatherless,When I saw I had help in the gate;</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/31-22.htm" target="_blank">22</a>Then let my arm fall from my shoulder,Let my arm be torn from the socket.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/31-23.htm" target="_blank">23</a>For destruction from God is a terror to me,And because of His magnificence I cannot endure.</p>

<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/31-24.htm" target="_blank">24</a>"If I have made gold my hope,Or said to fine gold, 'You are my confidence';</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/31-25.htm" target="_blank">25</a>If I have rejoiced because my wealth was great,And because my hand had gained much;</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/31-26.htm" target="_blank">26</a>If I have observed the sun when it shines,Or the moon moving in brightness,</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/31-27.htm" target="_blank">27</a>So that my heart has been secretly enticed,And my mouth has kissed my hand;</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/31-28.htm" target="_blank">28</a>This also would be an iniquity deserving of judgment,For I would have denied God who is above.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/31-29.htm" target="_blank">29</a>"If I have rejoiced at the destruction of him who hated me,Or lifted myself up when evil found him</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/31-30.htm" target="_blank">30</a>(Indeed I have not allowed my mouth to sinBy asking for a curse on his soul);</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/31-31.htm" target="_blank">31</a>If the men of my tent have not said,"Who is there that has not been satisfied with his meat?'</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/31-32.htm" target="_blank">32</a>(But no sojourner had to lodge in the street,For I have opened my doors to the traveler);</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/31-33.htm" target="_blank">33</a>If I have covered my transgressions as[i] Adam,By hiding my iniquity in my bosom,</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/31-34.htm" target="_blank">34</a>Because I feared the great multitude,And dreaded the contempt of families,So that I kept silenceAnd did not go out of the door"</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/31-35.htm" target="_blank">35</a>Oh, that I had one to hear me!Here is my mark.Oh, that the Almighty would answer me,That my Prosecutor had written a book!</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/31-36.htm" target="_blank">36</a>Surely I would carry it on my shoulder,And bind it on me like a crown;</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/31-37.htm" target="_blank">37</a>I would declare to Him the number of my steps;Like a prince I would approach Him.</p>

<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/31-38.htm" target="_blank">38</a>"If my land cries out against me,And its furrows weep together;</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/31-39.htm" target="_blank">39</a>If I have eaten its fruit without money,Or caused its owners to lose their lives;</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/31-40.htm" target="_blank">40</a>Then let thistles grow instead of wheat,And weeds instead of barley."The words of Job are ended.</p>
