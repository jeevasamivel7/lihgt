<h2> Job 14 </h2>


<h4>Job Speaks of Life's Woes</h4>

<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/14-1.htm" target="_blank">1</a>"Man who is born of womanIs of few days and full of trouble.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/14-2.htm" target="_blank">2</a>He comes forth like a flower and fades away;He flees like a shadow and does not continue.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/14-3.htm" target="_blank">3</a>And do You open Your eyes on such a one,And bring me to judgment with Yourself?</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/14-4.htm" target="_blank">4</a>Who can bring a clean thing out of an unclean?No one!</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/14-5.htm" target="_blank">5</a>Since his days are determined,The number of his months is with You;You have appointed his limits, so that he cannot pass.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/14-6.htm" target="_blank">6</a>Look away from him that he may rest,Till like a hired man he finishes his day.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/14-7.htm" target="_blank">7</a>"For there is hope for a tree,If it is cut down, that it will sprout again,And that its tender shoots will not cease.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/14-8.htm" target="_blank">8</a>Though its root may grow old in the earth,And its stump may die in the ground,</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/14-9.htm" target="_blank">9</a>Yet at the scent of water it will budAnd bring forth branches like a plant.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/14-10.htm" target="_blank">10</a>But man dies and is laid away;Indeed he breathes his lastAnd where is he?</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/14-11.htm" target="_blank">11</a>As water disappears from the sea,And a river becomes parched and dries up,</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/14-12.htm" target="_blank">12</a>So man lies down and does not rise.Till the heavens are no more,They will not awakeNor be roused from their sleep.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/14-13.htm" target="_blank">13</a>"Oh, that You would hide me in the grave,That You would conceal me until Your wrath is past,That You would appoint me a set time, and remember me!</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/14-14.htm" target="_blank">14</a>If a man dies, shall he live again?All the days of my hard service I will wait,Till my change comes.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/14-15.htm" target="_blank">15</a>You shall call, and I will answer You;You shall desire the work of Your hands.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/14-16.htm" target="_blank">16</a>For now You number my steps,But do not watch over my sin.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/14-17.htm" target="_blank">17</a>My transgression is sealed up in a bag,And You cover my iniquity.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/14-18.htm" target="_blank">18</a>But as a mountain falls and crumbles away,And as a rock is moved from its place;</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/14-19.htm" target="_blank">19</a>As water wears away stones,And as torrents wash away the soil of the earth;So You destroy the hope of man.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/14-20.htm" target="_blank">20</a>You prevail forever against him, and he passes on;You change his countenance and send him away.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/14-21.htm" target="_blank">21</a>His sons come to honor, and he does not know it;They are brought low, and he does not perceive it.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/14-22.htm" target="_blank">22</a>But his flesh will be in pain over it,And his soul will mourn over it."</p>
