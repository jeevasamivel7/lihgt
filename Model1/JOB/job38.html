<h2> Job 38 </h2>


<h4>The Lord Reveals His Omnipotence to Job</h4>

<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/38-1.htm" target="_blank">1</a>Then the Lord answered Job out of the whirlwind, and said:</p>

<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/38-2.htm" target="_blank">2</a>Who is this who darkens counselBy words without knowledge?</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/38-3.htm" target="_blank">3</a>Now prepare yourself like a man;I will question you, and you shall answer Me.</p>

<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/38-4.htm" target="_blank">4</a>"Where were you when I laid the foundations of the earth?Tell Me, if you have understanding.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/38-5.htm" target="_blank">5</a>Who determined its measurements?Surely you know!Or who stretched the line upon it?</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/38-6.htm" target="_blank">6</a>To what were its foundations fastened?Or who laid its cornerstone,</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/38-7.htm" target="_blank">7</a>When the morning stars sang together,And all the sons of God shouted for joy?</p>

<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/38-8.htm" target="_blank">8</a>"Or who shut in the sea with doors,When it burst forth and issued from the womb;</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/38-9.htm" target="_blank">9</a>When I made the clouds its garment,And thick darkness its swaddling band;</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/38-10.htm" target="_blank">10</a>When I fixed My limit for it,And set bars and doors;</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/38-11.htm" target="_blank">11</a>When I said,"This far you may come, but no farther,And here your proud waves must stop!"</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/38-12.htm" target="_blank">12</a>"Have you commanded the morning since your days began,And caused the dawn to know its place,</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/38-13.htm" target="_blank">13</a>That it might take hold of the ends of the earth,And the wicked be shaken out of it?</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/38-14.htm" target="_blank">14</a>It takes on form like clay under a seal,And stands out like a garment.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/38-15.htm" target="_blank">15</a>From the wicked their light is withheld,And the upraised arm is broken.</p>

<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/38-16.htm" target="_blank">16</a>"Have you entered the springs of the sea?Or have you walked in search of the depths?</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/38-17.htm" target="_blank">17</a>Have the gates of death been revealed to you?Or have you seen the doors of the shadow of death?</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/38-18.htm" target="_blank">18</a>Have you comprehended the breadth of the earth?Tell Me, if you know all this.</p>

<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/38-19.htm" target="_blank">19</a>"Where is the way to the dwelling of light?And darkness, where is its place,</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/38-20.htm" target="_blank">20</a>That you may take it to its territory,That you may know the paths to its home?</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/38-21.htm" target="_blank">21</a>Do you know it, because you were born then,Or because the number of your days is great?</p>

<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/38-22.htm" target="_blank">22</a>"Have you entered the treasury of snow,Or have you seen the treasury of hail,</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/38-23.htm" target="_blank">23</a>Which I have reserved for the time of trouble,For the day of battle and war?</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/38-24.htm" target="_blank">24</a>By what way is light diffused,Or the east wind scattered over the earth?</p>

<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/38-25.htm" target="_blank">25</a>"Who has divided a channel for the overflowing water,Or a path for the thunderbolt,</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/38-26.htm" target="_blank">26</a>To cause it to rain on a land where there is no one,A wilderness in which there is no man;</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/38-27.htm" target="_blank">27</a>To satisfy the desolate waste,And cause to spring forth the growth of tender grass?</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/38-28.htm" target="_blank">28</a>Has the rain a father?Or who has begotten the drops of dew?</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/38-29.htm" target="_blank">29</a>From whose womb comes the ice?And the frost of heaven, who gives it birth?</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/38-30.htm" target="_blank">30</a>The waters harden like stone,And the surface of the deep is frozen.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/38-31.htm" target="_blank">31</a>"Can you bind the cluster of the Pleiades,Or loose the belt of Orion?</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/38-32.htm" target="_blank">32</a>Can you bring out Mazzaroth in its season?Or can you guide the Great Bear with its cubs?</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/38-33.htm" target="_blank">33</a>Do you know the ordinances of the heavens?Can you set their dominion over the earth?</p>

<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/38-34.htm" target="_blank">34</a>"Can you lift up your voice to the clouds,That an abundance of water may cover you?</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/38-35.htm" target="_blank">35</a>Can you send out lightnings, that they may go,And say to you, "Here we are!"?</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/38-36.htm" target="_blank">36</a>Who has put wisdom in the mind?Or who has given understanding to the heart?</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/38-37.htm" target="_blank">37</a>Who can number the clouds by wisdom?Or who can pour out the bottles of heaven,</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/38-38.htm" target="_blank">38</a>When the dust hardens in clumps,And the clods cling together?</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/38-39.htm" target="_blank">39</a>"Can you hunt the prey for the lion,Or satisfy the appetite of the young lions,</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/38-40.htm" target="_blank">40</a>When they crouch in their dens,Or lurk in their lairs to lie in wait?</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/38-41.htm" target="_blank">41</a>Who provides food for the raven,When its young ones cry to God,And wander about for lack of food?</p>
