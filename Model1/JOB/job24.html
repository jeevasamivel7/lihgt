<h2> Job 24 </h2>


<h4>Job Complains of Violence on the Earth</h4>

<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/24.htm" target="_blank">1</a>"Since times are not hidden from the Almighty,Why do those who know Him see not His days?</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/24-2.htm" target="_blank">2</a>"Some remove landmarks;They seize flocks violently and feed on them;</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/24-3.htm" target="_blank">3</a>They drive away the donkey of the fatherless;They take the widow's ox as a pledge.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/24-4.htm" target="_blank">4</a>They push the needy off the road;All the poor of the land are forced to hide.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/24-5.htm" target="_blank">5</a>Indeed, like wild donkeys in the desert,They go out to their work, searching for food.The wilderness yields food for them and for their children.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/24-6.htm" target="_blank">6</a>They gather their fodder in the fieldAnd glean in the vineyard of the wicked.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/24-7.htm" target="_blank">7</a>They spend the night naked, without clothing,And have no covering in the cold.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/24-8.htm" target="_blank">8</a>They are wet with the showers of the mountains,And huddle around the rock for want of shelter.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/24-9.htm" target="_blank">9</a>"Some snatch the fatherless from the breast,And take a pledge from the poor.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/24-10.htm" target="_blank">10</a>They cause the poor to go naked, without clothing;And they take away the sheaves from the hungry.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/24-11.htm" target="_blank">11</a>They press out oil within their walls,And tread winepresses, yet suffer thirst.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/24-12.htm" target="_blank">12</a>The dying groan in the city,And the souls of the wounded cry out;Yet God does not charge them with wrong.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/24-13.htm" target="_blank">13</a>"There are those who rebel against the light;They do not know its waysNor abide in its paths.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/24-14.htm" target="_blank">14</a>The murderer rises with the light;He kills the poor and needy;And in the night he is like a thief.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/24-15.htm" target="_blank">15</a>The eye of the adulterer waits for the twilight,Saying,'No eye will see me';And he disguises his face.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/24-16.htm" target="_blank">16</a>In the dark they break into housesWhich they marked for themselves in the daytime;They do not know the light.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/24-17.htm" target="_blank">17</a>For the morning is the same to them as the shadow of death;If someone recognizes them,They are in the terrors of the shadow of death.</p>

<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/24-18.htm" target="_blank">18</a>"They should be swift on the face of the waters,Their portion should be cursed in the earth,So that no one would turn into the way of their vineyards.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/24-19.htm" target="_blank">19</a>As drought and heat consume the snow waters,So the grave consumes those who have sinned.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/24-20.htm" target="_blank">20</a>The womb should forget him,The worm should feed sweetly on him;He should be remembered no more,And wickedness should be broken like a tree.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/24-21.htm" target="_blank">21</a>For he preys on the barren who do not bear,And does no good for the widow.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/24-22.htm" target="_blank">22</a>"But God draws the mighty away with His power;He rises up, but no man is sure of life.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/24-23.htm" target="_blank">23</a>He gives them security, and they rely on it;Yet His eyes are on their ways.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/24-24.htm" target="_blank">24</a>They are exalted for a little while,Then they are gone.They are brought low;They are taken out of the way like all others;They dry out like the heads of grain.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/24-25.htm" target="_blank">25</a>"Now if it is not so, who will prove me a liar,And make my speech worth nothing?"</p>
