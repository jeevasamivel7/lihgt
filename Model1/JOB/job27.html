<h2> Job 27 </h2>


<h4>Job Maintains His Integrity</h4>

<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/27-1.htm" target="_blank">1</a>Moreover Job continued his discourse, and said:</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/27-2.htm" target="_blank">2</a>"As God lives, who has taken away my justice,And the Almighty, who has made my soul bitter,</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/27-3.htm" target="_blank">3</a>As long as my breath is in me,And the breath of God in my nostrils,</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/27-4.htm" target="_blank">4</a>My lips will not speak wickedness,Nor my tongue utter deceit.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/27-5.htm" target="_blank">5</a>Far be it from meThat I should say you are right;Till I die I will not put away my integrity from me.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/27-6.htm" target="_blank">6</a>My righteousness I hold fast, and will not let it go;My heart shall not reproach me as long as I live.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/27-7.htm" target="_blank">7</a>"May my enemy be like the wicked,And he who rises up against me like the unrighteous.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/27-8.htm" target="_blank">8</a>For what is the hope of the hypocrite,Though he may gain much,If God takes away his life?</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/27-9.htm" target="_blank">9</a>Will God hear his cryWhen trouble comes upon him?</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/27-10.htm" target="_blank">10</a>Will he delight himself in the Almighty?Will he always call on God?</p>

<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/27-11.htm" target="_blank">11</a>"I will teach you about the hand of God;What is with the Almighty I will not conceal.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/27-12.htm" target="_blank">12</a>Surely all of you have seen it;Why then do you behave with complete nonsense?</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/27-13.htm" target="_blank">13</a>"This is the portion of a wicked man with God,And the heritage of oppressors, received from the Almighty:</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/27-14.htm" target="_blank">14</a>If his children are multiplied, it is for the sword;And his offspring shall not be satisfied with bread.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/27-15.htm" target="_blank">15</a>Those who survive him shall be buried in death,And their widows shall not weep,</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/27-16.htm" target="_blank">16</a>Though he heaps up silver like dust,And piles up clothing like clay"</p> 
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/27-17.htm" target="_blank">17</a>He may pile it up, but the just will wear it,And the innocent will divide the silver.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/27-18.htm" target="_blank">18</a>He builds his house like a moth,Like a booth which a watchman makes.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/27-19.htm" target="_blank">19</a>The rich man will lie down,But not be gathered up;He opens his eyes,And he is no more.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/27-20.htm" target="_blank">20</a>Terrors overtake him like a flood;A tempest steals him away in the night.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/27-21.htm" target="_blank">21</a>The east wind carries him away, and he is gone;It sweeps him out of his place.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/27-22.htm" target="_blank">22</a>It hurls against him and does not spare;He flees desperately from its power.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/27-23.htm" target="_blank">23</a>Men shall clap their hands at him,And shall hiss him out of his place.</p>
