<h2> Job 18 </h2>


<h4>Bildad: The Wicked Are Punished</h4>

<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/18-1.htm" target="_blank">1</a>Then Bildad the Shuhite answered and said:</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/18-2.htm" target="_blank">2</a>"How long till you put an end to words?Gain understanding, and afterward we will speak.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/18-3.htm" target="_blank">3</a>Why are we counted as beasts,And regarded as stupid in your sight?</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/18-4.htm" target="_blank">4</a>You who tear yourself in anger,</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/18-5.htm" target="_blank">5</a>"The light of the wicked indeed goes out,And the flame of his fire does not shine.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/18-6.htm" target="_blank">6</a>The light is dark in his tent,And his lamp beside him is put out.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/18-7.htm" target="_blank">7</a>The steps of his strength are shortened,And his own counsel casts him down.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/18-8.htm" target="_blank">8</a>For he is cast into a net by his own feet,And he walks into a snare.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/18-9.htm" target="_blank">9</a>The net takes him by the heel,And a snare lays hold of him.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/18-10.htm" target="_blank">10</a>A noose is hidden for him on the ground,And a trap for him in the road.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/18-11.htm" target="_blank">11</a>Terrors frighten him on every side,And drive him to his feet.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/18-12.htm" target="_blank">12</a>His strength is starved,And destruction is ready at his side.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/18-13.htm" target="_blank">13</a>It devours patches of his skin;The firstborn of death devours his limbs.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/18-14.htm" target="_blank">14</a>He is uprooted from the shelter of his tent,And they parade him before the king of terrors.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/18-15.htm" target="_blank">15</a>They dwell in his tent who are none of his;Brimstone is scattered on his dwelling.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/18-16.htm" target="_blank">16</a>His roots are dried out below,And his branch withers above.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/18-17.htm" target="_blank">17</a>The memory of him perishes from the earth,And he has no name among the renowned.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/18-18.htm" target="_blank">18</a>He is driven from light into darkness,And chased out of the world.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/18-19.htm" target="_blank">19</a>He has neither son nor posterity among his people,Nor any remaining in his dwellings.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/18-20.htm" target="_blank">20</a>Those in the west are astonished at his day,As those in the east are frightened.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/18-21.htm" target="_blank">21</a>Surely such are the dwellings of the wicked,And this is the place of him who does not know God."</p>
