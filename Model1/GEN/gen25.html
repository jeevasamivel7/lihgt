<h2>Genesis 25</h2>


<h4>Abraham and Keturah</h4>



<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/25-1.htm" target="_blank">1</a>Abraham again took a wife, and her name was Keturah.
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/25-2.htm" target="_blank">2</a>And she bore him Zimran, Jokshan, Medan, Midian, Ishbak, and Shuah. 
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/25-3.htm" target="_blank">3</a>Jokshan begot Sheba and Dedan. And the sons of Dedan were Asshurim, Letushim, and Leummim.
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/25-4.htm" target="_blank">4</a>And the sons of Midian were Ephah, Epher, Hanoch, Abidah, and Eldaah. All these were the children of Keturah.</p>

<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/25-5.htm" target="_blank">5</a>And Abraham gave all that he had to Isaac. 
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/25-6.htm" target="_blank">6</a>But Abraham gave gifts to the sons of the concubines which Abraham had; and while he was still living he sent them eastward, away from Isaac his son, to the country of the east.</p>

<h4>Abraham's Death and Burial</h4>

<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/25-7.htm" target="_blank">7</a>This is the sum of the years of Abraham's life which he lived: one hundred and seventy-five years.
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/25-8.htm" target="_blank">8</a>Then Abraham breathed his last and died in a good old age, an old man and full of years, and was gathered to his people. 
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/25-9.htm" target="_blank">9</a>And his sons Isaac and Ishmael buried him in the cave of Machpelah, which is before Mamre, in the field of Ephron the son of Zohar the Hittite,
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/25-10.htm" target="_blank">10</a>the field which Abraham purchased from the sons of Heth. There Abraham was buried, and Sarah his wife. 
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/25-11.htm" target="_blank">11</a>And it came to pass, after the death of Abraham, that God blessed his son Isaac. And Isaac dwelt at Beer Lahai Roi.</p>

<h4>The Families of Ishmael and Isaac</h4>

<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/25-12.htm" target="_blank">12</a>Now this is the genealogy of Ishmael, Abraham's son, whom Hagar the Egyptian, Sarah"s maidservant, bore to Abraham. 
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/25-13.htm" target="_blank">13</a>And these were the names of the sons of Ishmael, by their names, according to their generations: The firstborn of Ishmael, Nebajoth; then Kedar, Adbeel, Mibsam, 
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/25-14.htm" target="_blank">14</a>Mishma, Dumah, Massa, 
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/25-15.htm" target="_blank">15</a>Hadar, Tema, Jetur, Naphish, and Kedemah. 
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/25-16.htm" target="_blank">16</a>These were the sons of Ishmael and these were their names, by their towns and their settlements, twelve princes according to their nations.
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/25-17.htm" target="_blank">17</a>These were the years of the life of Ishmael: one hundred and thirty-seven years; and he breathed his last and died, and was gathered to his people. 
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/25-18.htm" target="_blank">18</a>(They dwelt from Havilah as far as Shur, which is east of Egypt as you go toward Assyria.) He died in the presence of all his brethren.</p>

<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/25-19.htm" target="_blank">19</a>This is the genealogy of Isaac, Abraham's son. Abraham begot Isaac. 
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/25-20.htm" target="_blank">20</a>Isaac was forty years old when he took Rebekah as wife, the daughter of Bethuel the Syrian of Padan Aram, the sister of Laban the Syrian.
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/25-21.htm" target="_blank">21</a>Now Isaac pleaded with the Lord for his wife, because she was barren; and the Lord granted his plea, and Rebekah his wife conceived.
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/25-22.htm" target="_blank">22</a>But the children struggled together within her; and she said, "If all is well, why am I like this?" So she went to inquire of the Lord.</p>

<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/25-23.htm" target="_blank">23</a>And the Lord said to her:"Two nations are in your womb,Two peoples shall be separated from your body;One people shall be stronger than the other,And the older shall serve the younger."</p>

<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/25-24.htm" target="_blank">24</a>So when her days were fulfilled for her to give birth, indeed there were twins in her womb. 
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/55-25.htm" target="_blank">25</a>And the first came out red. He was like a hairy garment all over; so they called his name Esau. 
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/25-26.htm" target="_blank">26</a>Afterward his brother came out, and his hand took hold of Esau's heel; so his name was called Jacob. Isaac was sixty years old when she bore them.</p>

<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/25-27.htm" target="_blank">27</a>So the boys grew. And Esau was a skillful hunter, a man of the field; but Jacob was a mild man, dwelling in tents. 
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/25-28.htm" target="_blank">28</a>And Isaac loved Esau because he ate of his game, but Rebekah loved Jacob.</p>

<h4>Esau Sells His Birthright</h4>

<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/25-29.htm" target="_blank">29</a>Now Jacob cooked a stew; and Esau came in from the field, and he was weary. 
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/25-30.htm" target="_blank">30</a>And Esau said to Jacob, "Please feed me with that same red stew, for I am weary." Therefore his name was called Edom.</p>

<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/25-31.htm" target="_blank">31</a>But Jacob said, "Sell me your birthright as of this day."</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/25-32.htm" target="_blank">32</a>And Esau said, "Look, I am about to die; so what is this birthright to me?"</p>

<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/25-33.htm" target="_blank">33</a>Then Jacob said, "Swear to me as of this day."So he swore to him, and sold his birthright to Jacob. 
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/25-34.htm" target="_blank">34</a>And Jacob gave Esau bread and stew of lentils; then he ate and drank, arose, and went his way. Thus Esau despised his birthright.</p>
