<h2>Genesis 36</h2>


<h4>The Family of Esau</h4>

<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/36-1.htm" target="_blank">1</a>Now this is the genealogy of Esau, who is Edom. 
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/36-2.htm" target="_blank">2</a>Esau took his wives from the daughters of Canaan: Adah the daughter of Elon the Hittite; Aholibamah the daughter of Anah, the daughter of Zibeon the Hivite; 
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/36-3.htm" target="_blank">3</a>and Basemath, Ishmael's daughter, sister of Nebajoth. 
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/36-4.htm" target="_blank">4</a>Now Adah bore Eliphaz to Esau, and Basemath bore Reuel. 
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/36-5.htm" target="_blank">5</a>And Aholibamah bore Jeush, Jaalam, and Korah. These were the sons of Esau who were born to him in the land of Canaan.</p>

<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/36-6.htm" target="_blank">6</a>Then Esau took his wives, his sons, his daughters, and all the persons of his household, his cattle and all his animals, and all his goods which he had gained in the land of Canaan, and went to a country away from the presence of his brother Jacob. 
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/36-7.htm" target="_blank">7</a>For their possessions were too great for them to dwell together, and the land where they were strangers could not support them because of their livestock. 
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/36-8.htm" target="_blank">8</a>So Esau dwelt in Mount Seir. Esau is Edom.</p>

<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/36-9.htm" target="_blank">9</a>And this is the genealogy of Esau the father of the Edomites in Mount Seir.

<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/36-12.htm" target="_blank">12</a>Now Timna was the concubine of Eliphaz, Esau's son, and she bore Amalek to Eliphaz. These were the sons of Adah, Esau's wife.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/36-13.htm" target="_blank">13</a>These were the sons of Reuel: Nahath, Zerah, Shammah, and Mizzah. These were the sons of Basemath, Esau's wife.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/36-14.htm" target="_blank">14</a>These were the sons of Aholibamah, Esau's wife, the daughter of Anah, the daughter of Zibeon. And she bore to Esau: Jeush, Jaalam, and Korah.</p>
