<h2>Genesis 35</h2>


<h4>Jacob's Return to Bethel</h4>


<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/35-1.htm" target="_blank">1</a>Then God said to Jacob, "Arise, go up to Bethel and dwell there; and make an altar there to God, who appeared to you when you fled from the face of Esau your brother."</p>

 <p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/35-2.htm" target="_blank">2</a>And Jacob said to his household and to all who were with him, "Put away the foreign gods that are among you, purify yourselves, and change your garments. 
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/35-3.htm" target="_blank">3</a>Then let us arise and go up to Bethel; and I will make an altar there to God, who answered me in the day of my distress and has been with me in the way which I have gone."
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/35-4.htm" target="_blank">4</a>So they gave Jacob all the foreign gods which were in their hands, and the earrings which were in their ears; and Jacob hid them under the terebinth tree which was by Shechem.</p>

<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/35-5.htm" target="_blank">5</a>And they journeyed, and the terror of God was upon the cities that were all around them, and they did not pursue the sons of Jacob. 
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/35-6.htm" target="_blank">6</a>So Jacob came to Luz (that is, Bethel), which is in the land of Canaan, he and all the people who were with him. 
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/35-7.htm" target="_blank">7</a>And he built an altar there and called the place El Bethel, because there God appeared to him when he fled from the face of his brother.</p>

<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/35-8.htm" target="_blank">8</a>Now Deborah, Rebekah's nurse, died, and she was buried below Bethel under the terebinth tree. So the name of it was called Allon Bachuth.</p>

<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/35-9.htm" target="_blank">9</a>Then God appeared to Jacob again, when he came from Padan Aram, and blessed him. 
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/35-10.htm" target="_blank">10</a>And God said to him, "Your name is Jacob; your name shall not be called Jacob anymore, but Israel shall be your name." So He called his name Israel. 
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/35-11.htm" target="_blank">11</a>Also God said to him: "I am God Almighty. Be fruitful and multiply; a nation and a company of nations shall proceed from you, and kings shall come from your body. 
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/35-12.htm" target="_blank">12</a>The land which I gave Abraham and Isaac I give to you; and to your descendants after you I give this land." 
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/35-13.htm" target="_blank">13</a>Then God went up from him in the place where He talked with him. 
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/35-14.htm" target="_blank">14</a>So Jacob set up a pillar in the place where He talked with him, a pillar of stone; and he poured a drink offering on it, and he poured oil on it.
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/35-15.htm" target="_blank">15</a>And Jacob called the name of the place where God spoke with him, Bethel.</p>

<h4>Death of Rachel</h4>

<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/35-16.htm" target="_blank">16</a>Then they journeyed from Bethel. And when there was but a little distance to go to Ephrath, Rachel labored in childbirth, and she had hard labor. 
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/35-17.htm" target="_blank">17</a>Now it came to pass, when she was in hard labor, that the midwife said to her, "Do not fear; you will have this son also."
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/35-18.htm" target="_blank">18</a>And so it was, as her soul was departing (for she died), that she called his name Ben-Oni; but his father called him Benjamin. 
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/35-19.htm" target="_blank">19</a>So Rachel died and was buried on the way to Ephrath (that is, Bethlehem). 
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/35-20.htm" target="_blank">20</a>And Jacob set a pillar on her grave, which is the pillar of Rachel's grave to this day.</p>

<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/35-21.htm" target="_blank">21</a>Then Israel journeyed and pitched his tent beyond the tower of Eder. 
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/35-22.htm" target="_blank">22</a>And it happened, when Israel dwelt in that land, that Reuben went and lay with Bilhah his father's concubine; and Israel heard about it.</p>

<h4>Jacob's Twelve Sons</h4>

<h5> Now the sons of Jacob were twelve:</h4>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/35-23.htm" target="_blank">23</a>the sons of Leah were Reuben, Jacob's firstborn, and Simeon, Levi, Judah, Issachar, and Zebulun;
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/35-24.htm" target="_blank">24</a>the sons of Rachel were Joseph and Benjamin; 
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/35-25.htm" target="_blank">25</a>the sons of Bilhah, Rachel's maidservant, were Dan and Naphtali;
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/35-26.htm" target="_blank">26</a>and the sons of Zilpah, Leah's maidservant, were Gad and Asher. These were the sons of Jacob who were born to him in Padan Aram.</p>

<h4>Death of Isaac</h4>

<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/35-27.htm" target="_blank">27</a>Then Jacob came to his father Isaac at Mamre, or Kirjath Arba[g] (that is, Hebron), where Abraham and Isaac had dwelt. 
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/35-28.htm" target="_blank">28</a>Now the days of Isaac were one hundred and eighty years. 
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/35-29.htm" target="_blank">29</a>So Isaac breathed his last and died, and was gathered to his people, being old and full of days. And his sons Esau and Jacob buried him.</p>
