<h2>Genesis 22</h2>


<h4>Abraham"s Faith Confirmed</h4>



<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/22-1.htm" target="_blank">1</a>Now it came to pass after these things that God tested Abraham, and said to him, "Abraham!"And he said, "Here I am."</p>

 <p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/22-2.htm" target="_blank">2</a>Then He said, "Take now your son, your only son Isaac, whom you love, and go to the land of Moriah, and offer him there as a burnt offering on one of the mountains of which I shall tell you."</p>

<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/22-3.htm" target="_blank">3</a>So Abraham rose early in the morning and saddled his donkey, and took two of his young men with him, and Isaac his son; and he split the wood for the burnt offering, and arose and went to the place of which God had told him.
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/22-4.htm" target="_blank">4</a>Then on the third day Abraham lifted his eyes and saw the place afar off. 
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/22-5.htm" target="_blank">5</a>And Abraham said to his young men, "Stay here with the donkey; the lad and I will go yonder and worship, and we will come back to you."</p>

<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/22-6.htm" target="_blank">6</a>So Abraham took the wood of the burnt offering and laid it on Isaac his son; and he took the fire in his hand, and a knife, and the two of them went together. 
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/22-7.htm" target="_blank">7</a>But Isaac spoke to Abraham his father and said, "My father!"And he said, "Here I am, my son."Then he said, "Look, the fire and the wood, but where is the lamb for a burnt offering?"</p>

<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/22-8.htm" target="_blank">8</a>And Abraham said, "My son, God will provide for Himself the lamb for a burnt offering." So the two of them went together.</p>

<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/22-9.htm" target="_blank">9</a>Then they came to the place of which God had told him. And Abraham built an altar there and placed the wood in order; and he bound Isaac his son and laid him on the altar, upon the wood. 
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/22-10.htm" target="_blank">10</a>And Abraham stretched out his hand and took the knife to slay his son.</p>

<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/22-11.htm" target="_blank">11</a>But the Angel of the Lord called to him from heaven and said, "Abraham, Abraham!"So he said, "Here I am."</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/22-12.htm" target="_blank">12</a>And He said, "Do not lay your hand on the lad, or do anything to him; for now I know that you fear God, since you have not withheld your son, your only son, from Me."</p>

<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/22-13.htm" target="_blank">13</a>Then Abraham lifted his eyes and looked, and there behind him was a ram caught in a thicket by its horns. So Abraham went and took the ram, and offered it up for a burnt offering instead of his son. 
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/22-14.htm" target="_blank">14</a>And Abraham called the name of the place, The-Lord-Will-Provide; as it is said to this day, "In the Mount of the Lord it shall be provided."</p>

<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/22-15.htm" target="_blank">15</a>Then the Angel of the Lord called to Abraham a second time out of heaven, 
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/22-16.htm" target="_blank">16</a>and said: "By Myself I have sworn, says the Lord, because you have done this thing, and have not withheld your son, your only son" 
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/22-17.htm" target="_blank">17</a>blessing I will bless you, and multiplying I will multiply your descendants as the stars of the heaven and as the sand which is on the seashore; and your descendants shall possess the gate of their enemies. 
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/22-18.htm" target="_blank">18</a>In your seed all the nations of the earth shall be blessed, because you have obeyed My voice."
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/22-19.htm" target="_blank">19</a>So Abraham returned to his young men, and they rose and went together to Beersheba; and Abraham dwelt at Beersheba.</p>

<h4>The Family of Nahor</h4>

<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/22-20.htm" target="_blank">20</a>Now it came to pass after these things that it was told Abraham, saying, "Indeed Milcah also has borne children to your brother Nahor:
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/22-21.htm" target="_blank">21</a>Huz his firstborn, Buz his brother, Kemuel the father of Aram, 
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/22-22.htm" target="_blank">22</a>Chesed, Hazo, Pildash, Jidlaph, and Bethuel." 
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/22-23.htm" target="_blank">23</a>And Bethuel begot Rebekah. These eight Milcah bore to Nahor, Abraham"s brother. 
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/22-24.htm" target="_blank">24</a>His concubine, whose name was Reumah, also bore Tebah, Gaham, Thahash, and Maachah.</p>
