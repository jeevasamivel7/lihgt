<h2>Numbers 1</h2>


<h4>The First Census of Israel</h4>


<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/1-1.htm" target="_blank">1</a>Now the Lord spoke to Moses in the Wilderness of Sinai, in the tabernacle of meeting, on the first day of the second month, in the second year after they had come out of the land of Egypt, saying: 
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/1-2.htm" target="_blank">2</a>�Take a census of all the congregation of the children of Israel, by their families, by their fathers� houses, according to the number of names, every male individually,
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/1-3.htm" target="_blank">3</a>from twenty years old and above�all who are able to go to war in Israel. You and Aaron shall number them by their armies.
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/1-4.htm" target="_blank">4</a>And with you there shall be a man from every tribe, each one the head of his father�s house.</p>

<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/1-5.htm" target="_blank">5</a>�These are the names of the men who shall stand with you: from Reuben, Elizur the son of Shedeur;
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/1-6.htm" target="_blank">6</a>from Simeon, Shelumiel the son of Zurishaddai;
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/1-7.htm" target="_blank">7</a>from Judah, Nahshon the son of Amminadab;  <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/1-8.htm" target="_blank">8</a>from Issachar, Nethanel the son of Zuar;
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/1-9.htm" target="_blank">9</a>from Zebulun, Eliab the son of Helon;

 <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/1-16.htm" target="_blank">16</a>These were chosen from the congregation, leaders of their fathers� tribes, heads of the divisions in Israel.</p>

<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/1-17.htm" target="_blank">17</a>Then Moses and Aaron took these men who had been mentioned by name, 
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/1-18.htm" target="_blank">18</a>and they assembled all the congregation together on the first day of the second month; and they recited their ancestry by families, by their fathers� houses, according to the number of names, from twenty years old and above, each one individually. 
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/1-19.htm" target="_blank">19</a>As the Lord commanded Moses, so he numbered them in the Wilderness of Sinai.</p>

<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/1-20.htm" target="_blank">20</a>Now the children of Reuben, Israel�s oldest son, their genealogies by their families, by their fathers� house, according to the number of names, every male individually, from twenty years old and above, all who were able to go to war:

</p>

<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/1-47.htm" target="_blank">47</a>But the Levites were not numbered among them by their fathers� tribe;  
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/1-48.htm" target="_blank">48</a>for the Lord had spoken to Moses, saying: 
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/1-49.htm" target="_blank">49</a>�Only the tribe of Levi you shall not number, nor take a census of them among the children of Israel;
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/1-50.htm" target="_blank">50</a>but you shall appoint the Levites over the tabernacle of the Testimony, over all its furnishings, and over all things that belong to it; they shall carry the tabernacle and all its furnishings; they shall attend to it and camp around the tabernacle. 
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/1-51.htm" target="_blank">51</a>And when the tabernacle is to go forward, the Levites shall take it down; and when the tabernacle is to be set up, the Levites shall set it up. The outsider who comes near shall be put to death. 
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/1-52.htm" target="_blank">52</a>The children of Israel shall pitch their tents, everyone by his own camp, everyone by his own standard, according to their armies; 
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/1-53.htm" target="_blank">53</a>but the Levites shall camp around the tabernacle of the Testimony, that there may be no wrath on the congregation of the children of Israel; and the Levites shall keep charge of the tabernacle of the Testimony.�
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/1-54.htm" target="_blank">54</a>Thus the children of Israel did; according to all that the Lord commanded Moses, so they did.</p>
