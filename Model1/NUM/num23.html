<h4>The Prophecies of Balaam</h4>



<p><a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/23-1.htm" target="_blank">1</a>Then Balaam said to Balak, “Build seven altars for me here, and prepare for me here seven bulls and seven rams.”</p>

<p><a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/23-2.htm" target="_blank">2</a>And Balak did just as Balaam had spoken, and Balak and Balaam offered a bull and a ram on each altar.
<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/23-3.htm" target="_blank">3</a>Then Balaam said to Balak, “Stand by your burnt offering, and I will go; perhaps the Lord will come to meet me, and whatever He shows me I will tell you.” So he went to a desolate height.
<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/23-4.htm" target="_blank">4</a>And God met Balaam, and he said to Him, “I have prepared the seven altars, and I have offered on each altar a bull and a ram.”</p>

<p><a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/23-5.htm" target="_blank">5</a>Then the Lord put a word in Balaam’s mouth, and said, “Return to Balak, and thus you shall speak.” 
<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/23-6.htm" target="_blank">6</a>So he returned to him, and there he was, standing by his burnt offering, he and all the princes of Moab.</p>

<p><a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/23-7.htm" target="_blank">7</a>And he took up his oracle and said:“Balak the king of Moab has brought me from Aram,From the mountains of the east.‘Come, curse Jacob for me,And come, denounce Israel!’</p>\

<p><a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/23-8.htm" target="_blank">8</a>“How shall I curse whom God has not cursed?And how shall I denounce whom the Lord has not denounced?
<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/23-9.htm" target="_blank">9</a>For from the top of the rocks I see him,And from the hills I behold him;There! A people dwelling alone,Not reckoning itself among the nations.</p>

<p><a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/23-10.htm" target="_blank">10</a>“Who can count the dust of Jacob,Or number one-fourth of Israel?Let me die the death of the righteous,And let my end be like his!”</p>

<p><a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/23-11.htm" target="_blank">11</a>Then Balak said to Balaam, “What have you done to me? I took you to curse my enemies, and look, you have blessed them bountifully!”</p>

<p><a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/23-12.htm" target="_blank">12</a>So he answered and said, “Must I not take heed to speak what the Lord has put in my mouth?”
Balaam’s Second Prophecy</p>

<p><a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/23-13.htm" target="_blank">13</a>Then Balak said to him, “Please come with me to another place from which you may see them; you shall see only the outer part of them, and shall not see them all; curse them for me from there.” 
<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/23-14.htm" target="_blank">14</a>So he brought him to the field of Zophim, to the top of Pisgah, and built seven altars, and offered a bull and a ram on each altar.</p>

<p><a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/23-15.htm" target="_blank">15</a>And he said to Balak, “Stand here by your burnt offering while I meet the Lord over there.”</p>

<p><a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/23-16.htm" target="_blank">16</a>Then the Lord met Balaam, and put a word in his mouth, and said, “Go back to Balak, and thus you shall speak.” 
<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/23-17.htm" target="_blank">17</a>So he came to him, and there he was, standing by his burnt offering, and the princes of Moab were with him. And Balak said to him, “What has the Lord spoken?”</p>

<p><a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/23-18.htm" target="_blank">18</a>Then he took up his oracle and said:“Rise up, Balak, and hear!Listen to me, son of Zippor!</p>

<p><a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/23-19.htm" target="_blank">19</a>“God is not a man, that He should lie,Nor a son of man, that He should repent.Has He said, and will He not do?Or has He spoken, and will He not make it good?
<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/23-20.htm" target="_blank">20</a>Behold, I have received a command to bless;
He has blessed, and I cannot reverse it.</p>

<p><a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/23-21.htm" target="_blank">21</a>“He has not observed iniquity in Jacob,Nor has He seen wickedness in Israel.The Lord his God is with him,And the shout of a King is among them.
<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/23-22.htm" target="_blank">22</a>God brings them out of Egypt;
He has strength like a wild ox.</p>

<p><a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/23-23.htm" target="_blank">23</a>“For there is no sorcery against Jacob,Nor any divination against Israel.It now must be said of Jacob And of Israel, ‘Oh, what God has done!’
<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/23-24.htm" target="_blank">24</a>Look, a people rises like a lioness,And lifts itself up like a lion;It shall not lie down until it devours the prey,And drinks the blood of the slain.”</p>

<p><a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/23-25.htm" target="_blank">25</a>Then Balak said to Balaam, “Neither curse them at all, nor bless them at all!”</p>

<p><a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/23-26.htm" target="_blank">26</a>So Balaam answered and said to Balak, “Did I not tell you, saying, ‘All that the Lord speaks, that I must do’?”Balaam’s Third Prophecy</p>

<p><a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/23-27.htm" target="_blank">27</a>Then Balak said to Balaam, “Please come, I will take you to another place; perhaps it will  please God that you may curse them for me from there.” 
<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/23-28.htm" target="_blank">28</a>So Balak took Balaam to the top of Peor, that overlooks the wasteland. 
<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/23-29.htm" target="_blank">29</a>Then Balaam said to Balak, “Build for me here seven altars, and prepare for me here seven bulls and seven rams.” 
<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/23-30.htm" target="_blank">30</a>And Balak did as Balaam had said, and offered a bull and a ram on every altar.</p>
