<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/2-18.htm" target="_blank">18</a>�On the west side shall be the standard of the forces with Ephraim according to their armies, and the leader of the children of Ephraim shall be Elishama the son of Ammihud.�

> <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/2-26.htm" target="_blank">26</a>And his army was numbered at sixty-two thousand seven hundred.</p>

<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/2-27.htm" target="_blank">27</a>�Those who camp next to him shall be the tribe of Asher, and the leader of the children of Asher shall be Pagiel the son of Ocran.�
