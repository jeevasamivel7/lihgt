<h2> Psalms 34 </h2>

<h4> The Happiness of Those Who Trust in God  </h4>
<h5>  A Psalm of David when he pretended madness before Abimelech, who drove him away, and he departed. </h5>

<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/34-1.htm">1</a>I will bless the Lord at all times;His praise shall continually be in my mouth.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/34-2.htm">2</a>My soul shall make its boast in the Lord;The humble shall hear of it and be glad.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/34-3.htm">3</a>Oh, magnify the Lord with me,And let us exalt His name together.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/34-4.htm">4</a>I sought the Lord, and He heard me,And delivered me from all my fears.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/34-5.htm">5</a>They looked to Him and were radiant,And their faces were not ashamed.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/34-6.htm">6</a>This poor man cried out, and the Lord heard him,And saved him out of all his troubles.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/34-7.htm">7</a>The angel of the Lord encamps all around those who fear Him,And delivers them.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/34-8.htm">8</a>Oh, taste and see that the Lord is good;Blessed is the man who trusts in Him!</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/34-9.htm">9</a>Oh, fear the Lord, you His saints!There is no want to those who fear Him.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/34-10.htm">10</a>The young lions lack and suffer hunger;But those who seek the Lord shall not lack any good thing.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/34-11.htm">11</a>Come, you children, listen to me;I will teach you the fear of the Lord.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/34-12.htm">12</a>Who is the man who desires life,And loves many days, that he may see good?</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/34-13.htm">13</a>Keep your tongue from evil,And your lips from speaking deceit.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/34-14.htm">14</a>Depart from evil and do good;Seek peace and pursue it.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/34-15.htm">15</a>The eyes of the Lord are on the righteous,And His ears are open to their cry.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/34-16.htm">16</a>The face of the Lord is against those who do evil,To cut off the remembrance of them from the earth.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/34-17.htm">17</a>The righteous cry out, and the Lord hears,And delivers them out of all their troubles.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/34-18.htm">18</a>The Lord is near to those who have a broken heart,And saves such as have a contrite spirit.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/34-19.htm">19</a>Many are the afflictions of the righteous,But the Lord delivers him out of them all.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/34-20.htm">20</a>He guards all his bones;Not one of them is broken.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/34-21.htm">21</a>Evil shall slay the wicked,And those who hate the righteous shall be condemned.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/34-22.htm">22</a>The Lord redeems the soul of His servants,And none of those who trust in Him shall be condemned.</p>
