<h2> proverbs 16 </h2>



<h4>Wisdom Is Better Than Gold</h4>

<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/16-1.htm" target="_blank">1</a>The preparations of the heart belong to man,But the answer of the tongue is from the Lord.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/16-2.htm" target="_blank">2</a>All the ways of a man are pure in his own eyes,But the Lord weighs the spirits.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/16-3.htm" target="_blank">3</a>Commit your works to the Lord,And your thoughts will be established.</p>

<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/16-4.htm" target="_blank">4</a>The Lord has made all for Himself,Yes, even the wicked for the day of doom.</p>

<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/16-5.htm" target="_blank">5</a>Everyone proud in heart is an abomination to the Lord;Though they join forces, none will go unpunished.</p>

<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/16-6.htm" target="_blank">6</a>In mercy and truthAtonement is provided for iniquity;And by the fear of the Lord one departs from evil.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/16-7.htm" target="_blank">7</a>When a man's ways please the Lord,He makes even his enemies to be at peace with him.</p>

<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/16-8.htm" target="_blank">8</a>Better is a little with righteousness,Than vast revenues without justice.</p>

<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/16-9.htm" target="_blank">9</a>A man's heart plans his way,But the Lord directs his steps.</p>

<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/16-10.htm" target="_blank">10</a>Divination is on the lips of the king;His mouth must not transgress in judgment.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/16-11.htm" target="_blank">11</a>Honest weights and scales are the Lord's;All the weights in the bag are His work.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/16-12.htm" target="_blank">12</a>It is an abomination for kings to commit wickedness,For a throne is established by righteousness.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/16-13.htm" target="_blank">13</a>Righteous lips are the delight of kings,And they love him who speaks what is right.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/16-14.htm" target="_blank">14</a>As messengers of death is the king's wrath,But a wise man will appease it.</p>

<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/16-15.htm" target="_blank">15</a>In the light of the king's face is life,And his favor is like a cloud of the latter rain.</p>

<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/16-16.htm" target="_blank">16</a>How much better to get wisdom than gold!And to get understanding is to be chosen rather than silver.</p>

<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/16-17.htm" target="_blank">17</a>The highway of the upright is to depart from evil;He who keeps his way preserves his soul.</p>


<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/16-18.htm" target="_blank">18</a>Pride goes before destruction,And a haughty spirit before a fall.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/16-19.htm" target="_blank">19</a>Better to be of a humble spirit with the lowly,Than to divide the spoil with the proud.</p>

<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/16-20.htm" target="_blank">20</a>He who heeds the word wisely will find good,And whoever trusts in the Lord, happy is he.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/16-21.htm" target="_blank">21</a>The wise in heart will be called prudent,And sweetness of the lips increases learning.</p>


<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/16-22.htm" target="_blank">22</a>Understanding is a wellspring of life to him who has it.But the correction of fools is folly.</p>

<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/16-23.htm" target="_blank">23</a>The heart of the wise teaches his mouth,And adds learning to his lips.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/16-24.htm" target="_blank">24</a>Pleasant words are like a honeycomb,Sweetness to the soul and health to the bones.</p>

<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/16-25.htm" target="_blank">25</a>There is a way that seems right to a man,But its end is the way of death.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/16-26.htm" target="_blank">26</a>The person who labors, labors for himself,For his hungry mouth drives him on.</p>

<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/16-27.htm" target="_blank">27</a>An ungodly man digs up evil,And it is on his lips like a burning fire.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/16-28.htm" target="_blank">28</a>A perverse man sows strife,And a whisperer separates the best of friends.</p>

<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/16-29.htm" target="_blank">29</a>A violent man entices his neighbor,And leads him in a way that is not good.</p>

And leads him in a way that is not good.

<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/16-30.htm" target="_blank">30</a>He winks his eye to devise perverse things;He purses his lips and brings about evil.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/16-31.htm" target="_blank">31</a>The silver-haired head is a crown of glory,If it is found in the way of righteousness.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/16-32.htm" target="_blank">32</a>He who is slow to anger is better than the mighty,And he who rules his spirit than he who takes a city.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/16-33.htm" target="_blank">33</a>The lot is cast into the lap,But its every decision is from the Lord.</p>
