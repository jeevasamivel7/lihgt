<h2> proverbs 20 </h2>



<h4>Wine Is a Mocker</h4>

<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/20-1.htm" target="_blank">1</a>Wine is a mocker,Strong drink is a brawler,And whoever is led astray by it is not wise.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/20-2.htm" target="_blank">2</a>The wrath of a king is like the roaring of a lion;Whoever provokes him to anger sins against his own life.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/20-3.htm" target="_blank">3</a>The wrath of a king is like the roaring of a lion;Whoever provokes him to anger sins against his own life.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/20-4.htm" target="_blank">4</a>The lazy man will not plow because of winter;He will beg during harvest and have nothing.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/20-5.htm" target="_blank">5</a>Counsel in the heart of man is like deep water,But a man of understanding will draw it out.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/20-6.htm" target="_blank">6</a>Most men will proclaim each his own goodness,But who can find a faithful man?</p>

<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/20-7.htm" target="_blank">7</a>The righteous man walks in his integrity;His children are blessed after him.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/20-8.htm" target="_blank">8</a>A king who sits on the throne of judgment Scatters all evil with his eyes.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/20-9.htm" target="_blank">9</a>Who can say, "I have made my heart clean,I am pure from my sin"?</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/20-10.htm" target="_blank">10</a>Diverse weights and diverse measures,They are both alike, an abomination to the Lord.</p>

<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/20-11.htm" target="_blank">11</a>Even a child is known by his deeds,Whether what he does is pure and right.</p>

<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/20-12.htm" target="_blank">12</a>The hearing ear and the seeing eye,The Lord has made them both.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/20-13.htm" target="_blank">13</a>Do not love sleep, lest you come to poverty;Open your eyes, and you will be satisfied with bread.</p>

<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/20-14.htm" target="_blank">14</a>"It is good for nothing," cries the buyer;But when he has gone his way, then he boasts.</p>


<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/20-15.htm" target="_blank">15</a>There is gold and a multitude of rubies,But the lips of knowledge are a precious jewel.</p>

<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/20-16.htm" target="_blank">16</a>Take the garment of one who is surety for a stranger,And hold it as a pledge when it is for a seductress.</p>

<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/20-17.htm" target="_blank">17</a>Bread gained by deceit is sweet to a man,But afterward his mouth will be filled with gravel.</p>


<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/20-18.htm" target="_blank">18</a>Plans are established by counsel;By wise counsel wage war.</p>

<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/20-19.htm" target="_blank">19</a>He who goes about as a talebearer reveals secrets;Therefore do not associate with one who flatters with his lips.</p>

<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/20-20.htm" target="_blank">20</a>Whoever curses his father or his mother,His lamp will be put out in deep darkness.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/20-21.htm" target="_blank">21</a>An inheritance gained hastily at the beginningWill not be blessed at the end.</p>


<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/20-22.htm" target="_blank">22</a>Do not say, "I will recompense evil";Wait for the Lord, and He will save you.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/20-23.htm" target="_blank">23</a>Diverse weights are an abomination to the Lord,And dishonest scales are not good.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/20-24.htm" target="_blank">24</a>A man's steps are of the Lord;How then can a man understand his own way?</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/20-25.htm" target="_blank">25</a>It is a snare for a man to devote rashly something as holy,And afterward to reconsider his vows.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/20-26.htm" target="_blank">26</a>A wise king sifts out the wicked,And brings the threshing wheel over them.</p>

<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/20-27.htm" target="_blank">27</a>The spirit of a man is the lamp of the Lord,Searching all the inner depths of his heart.</p>

<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/20-28.htm" target="_blank">28</a>Mercy and truth preserve the king,And by lovingkindness he upholds his throne.</p>

<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/20-29.htm" target="_blank">29</a>The glory of young men is their strength,And the splendor of old men is their gray head.</p>


<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/20-30.htm" target="_blank">30</a>Blows that hurt cleanse away evil,As do stripes the inner depths of the heart.</p>
