<h1>Proverbs 19 </h1>



<h1>The Fear of the Lord Leads to Life</h1>

<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/19-1.htm" target="_blank">1</a>Better is the poor who walks in his integrityThan one who is perverse in his lips, and is a fool.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/19-2.htm" target="_blank">2</a>Also it is not good for a soul to be without knowledge,And he sins who hastens with his feet.</p>

<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/19-3.htm" target="_blank">3</a>The foolishness of a man twists his way,And his heart frets against the Lord.</p>

<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/19-4.htm" target="_blank">4</a>Wealth makes many friends,But the poor is separated from his friend.</p>

<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/19-5.htm" target="_blank">5</a>A false witness will not go unpunished,And he who speaks lies will not escape.</p>

<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/19-6.htm" target="_blank">6</a>Many entreat the favor of the nobility,And every man is a friend to one who gives gifts.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/19-7.htm" target="_blank">7</a>All the brothers of the poor hate him;How much more do his friends go far from him!He may pursue them with words, yet they abandon him.</p>

<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/19-8.htm" target="_blank">8</a>He who gets wisdom loves his own soul;He who keeps understanding will find good.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/19-9.htm" target="_blank">9</a>A false witness will not go unpunished,And he who speaks lies shall perish.</p>

<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/19-10.htm" target="_blank">10</a>Luxury is not fitting for a fool,Much less for a servant to rule over princes.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/19-11.htm" target="_blank">11</a>The discretion of a man makes him slow to anger,And his glory is to overlook a transgression.</p>

<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/19-12.htm" target="_blank">12</a>The king's wrath is like the roaring of a lion,But his favor is like dew on the grass.</p>

<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/19-13.htm" target="_blank">13</a>A foolish son is the ruin of his father,And the contentions of a wife are a continual dripping.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/19-14.htm" target="_blank">14</a>Houses and riches are an inheritance from fathers,But a prudent wife is from the Lord.</p>

<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/19-15.htm" target="_blank">15</a>Laziness casts one into a deep sleep,And an idle person will suffer hunger.</p>

<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/19-16.htm" target="_blank">16</a>He who keeps the commandment keeps his soul,But he who is careless of his ways will die.</p>

<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/19-17.htm" target="_blank">17</a>He who has pity on the poor lends to the Lord,And He will pay back what he has given.</p>


<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/19-18.htm" target="_blank">18</a>Chasten your son while there is hope,And do not set your heart on his destruction.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/19-19.htm" target="_blank">19</a>A man of great wrath will suffer punishment;For if you rescue him, you will have to do it again.</p>

<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/19-20.htm" target="_blank">20</a>Listen to counsel and receive instruction,That you may be wise in your latter days.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/19-21.htm" target="_blank">21</a>There are many plans in a man's heart,Nevertheless the Lord's counsel-that will stand.</p>


<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/19-22.htm" target="_blank">22</a>What is desired in a man is kindness,And a poor man is better than a liar.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/19-23.htm" target="_blank">23</a>The fear of the Lord leads to life,And he who has it will abide in satisfaction;He will not be visited with evil.</p>

<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/19-24.htm" target="_blank">24</a>A lazy man buries his hand in the bowl,And will not so much as bring it to his mouth again.</p>

<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/19-25.htm" target="_blank">25</a>Strike a scoffer, and the simple will become wary;Rebuke one who has understanding, and he will discern knowledge.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/19-26.htm" target="_blank">26</a>He who mistreats his father and chases away his motherIs a son who causes shame and brings reproach.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/19-27.htm" target="_blank">27</a>Cease listening to instruction, my son,And you will stray from the words of knowledge.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/19-28.htm" target="_blank">28</a>A disreputable witness scorns justice,And the mouth of the wicked devours iniquity.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/19-29.htm" target="_blank">29</a>Judgments are prepared for scoffers,And beatings for the backs of fools.</p>
