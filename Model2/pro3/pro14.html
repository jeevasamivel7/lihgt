<h2> PROVERBS 14 </h2>

<h4> The Ways of Life and Death  </h4>

<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/14-1.htm" target="_blank">1</a>The wise woman builds her house,But the foolish pulls it down with her hands.</p> 
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/14-2.htm" target="_blank">2</a>He who walks in his uprightness fears the Lord,But he who is perverse in his ways despises Him.</p> 
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/14-3.htm" target="_blank">3</a>In the mouth of a fool is a rod of pride,But the lips of the wise will preserve them.</p> 
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/14-4.htm" target="_blank">4</a>Where no oxen are, the trough is clean;But much increase comes by the strength of an ox.</p> 
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/14-5.htm" target="_blank">5</a>A faithful witness does not lie,But a false witness will utter lies.</p> 
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/14-6.htm" target="_blank">6</a>A scoffer seeks wisdom and does not find it,But knowledge is easy to him who understands.</p> 
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/14-7.htm" target="_blank">7</a>Go from the presence of a foolish man,When you do not perceive in him the lips of knowledge.</p> 
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/14-8.htm" target="_blank">8</a>The wisdom of the prudent is to understand his way,But the folly of fools is deceit.</p> 
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/14-9.htm" target="_blank">9</a>Fools mock at sin,But among the upright there is favor.</p> 
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/14-10.htm" target="_blank">10</a>The heart knows its own bitterness,And a stranger does not share its joy.</p> 
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/14-11.htm" target="_blank">11</a>The house of the wicked will be overthrown,But the tent of the upright will flourish.</p> 
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/14-12.htm" target="_blank">12</a>There is a way that seems right to a man,But its end is the way of death.</p> 
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/14-13.htm" target="_blank">13</a>Even in laughter the heart may sorrow,And the end of mirth may be grief.</p> 
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/14-14.htm" target="_blank">14</a>The backslider in heart will be filled with his own ways,But a good man will be satisfied from above.</p> 
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/14-15.htm" target="_blank">15</a>The simple believes every word,But the prudent considers well his steps.</p> 
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/14-16.htm" target="_blank">16</a>A wise man fears and departs from evil,But a fool rages and is self-confident.</p> 
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/14-17.htm" target="_blank">17</a>A quick-tempered man acts foolishly,And a man of wicked intentions is hated.</p> 
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/14-18.htm" target="_blank">18</a>The simple inherit folly,But the prudent are crowned with knowledge.</p> 
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/14-19.htm" target="_blank">19</a>The evil will bow before the good,And the wicked at the gates of the righteous.</p> 
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/14-20.htm" target="_blank">20</a>The poor man is hated even by his own neighbor,But the rich has many friends.</p> 
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/14-21.htm" target="_blank">21</a>He who despises his neighbor sins;But he who has mercy on the poor, happy is he.</p> 
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/14-22.htm" target="_blank">22</a>Do they not go astray who devise evil?But mercy and truth belong to those who devise good.</p> 
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/14-23.htm" target="_blank">23</a>In all labor there is profit,But idle chatter leads only to poverty.</p> 
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/14-24.htm" target="_blank">24</a>The crown of the wise is their riches,But the foolishness of fools is folly.</p> 
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/14-25.htm" target="_blank">25</a>A true witness delivers souls,But a deceitful witness speaks lies.</p> 
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/14-26.htm" target="_blank">26</a>In the fear of the Lord there is strong confidence,And His children will have a place of refuge.</p> 
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/14-27.htm" target="_blank">27</a>The fear of the Lord is a fountain of life,To turn one away from the snares of death.</p> 
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/14-28.htm" target="_blank">28</a>In a multitude of people is a king's honor,But in the lack of people is the downfall of a prince.</p> 
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/14-29.htm" target="_blank">29</a>He who is slow to wrath has great understanding,But he who is impulsive exalts folly.</p> 
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/14-30.htm" target="_blank">30</a>A sound heart is life to the body,But envy is rottenness to the bones.</p> 
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/14-31.htm" target="_blank">31</a>He who oppresses the poor reproaches his Maker,But he who honors Him has mercy on the needy.</p> 
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/14-32.htm" target="_blank">32</a>The wicked is banished in his wickedness,But the righteous has a refuge in his death.</p> 
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/14-33.htm" target="_blank">33</a>Wisdom rests in the heart of him who has understanding,But what is in the heart of fools is made known.</p> 
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/14-34.htm" target="_blank">34</a>Righteousness exalts a nation,But sin is a reproach to any people.</p> 
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/14-35.htm" target="_blank">35</a>The king's favor is toward a wise servant,But his wrath is against him who causes shame.</p>
